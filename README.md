# Responsive Web Interface for Progbiz Pvt Ltd

This project demonstrates my ability to translate design elements into a functional UI by building a responsive web interface based on a provided Figma design. The task was part of a job interview for the frontend developer position at Progbiz Pvt Ltd.

## Project Overview

### Task Description
The objective was to replicate the layout and design of a given Figma file as closely as possible. The focus was on creating a responsive web interface that accurately reflects the design specifications.

### Figma Design
You can view the Figma design file [here](https://www.figma.com/design/C12XbH2YZtELWfETPCk4cE/TEST?node-id=0-1&t=jnGNLfw9UEaejobm-1).

### Focus Areas
- Replicate the layout and design of the UI as closely as possible
- Ensure the web interface is responsive and functional across different devices

### Deliverables
- Completed code files compressed in a ZIP folder
- Hosted link on Vercel

## Additional Information

### ESLint Configuration
This project uses a basic ESLint setup. For production applications, consider expanding the ESLint configuration as follows:

- Update `parserOptions` in the top-level configuration:
  ```js
  export default {
    parserOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 'latest',
      sourceType: 'module',
      project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    },
  }
  ```
- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.
- Optionally, add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`.
- Install `eslint-plugin-react` and add `plugin:react/recommended` and `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list.
